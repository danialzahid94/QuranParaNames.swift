# QuranParaNames.swift

A Swift NSObject class containing names of all Paras of the Quran in Arabic listed in a Dictionary against their Para numbers.

You can either retrieve the whole Dictionary or use the nameForParaNumber method to retreive a specific para name.

The Dictionary is in a very simple and generic format and can be copied and modified for any other language as well.

Do contribute to the repository anything you can make out of it.

Thanks.
